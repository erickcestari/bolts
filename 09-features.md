# BOLT #9: Assigned Feature Flags

This document tracks the assignment of `features` flags in the `init`
message ([BOLT #1](01-messaging.md)), as well as `features` fields in
the `channel_announcement` and `node_announcement` messages ([BOLT
#7](07-routing-gossip.md)).  The flags are tracked separately, since
new flags will likely be added over time.

Some features were introduced and became so widespread they are `ASSUMED` to be present by all nodes, and can be safely ignored (and the semantics are only defined in prior revisions of this spec).

Flags are numbered from the least-significant bit, at bit 0 (i.e. 0x1,
an _even_ bit). They are generally assigned in pairs so that features
can be introduced as optional (_odd_ bits) and later upgraded to be compulsory
(_even_ bits), which will be refused by outdated nodes:
see [BOLT #1: The `init` Message](01-messaging.md#the-init-message).

Some features don't make sense on a per-channels or per-node basis, so
each feature defines how it is presented in those contexts.  Some
features may be required for opening a channel, but not a requirement
for use of the channel, so the presentation of those features depends
on the feature itself.

The Context column decodes as follows:

* `I`: presented in the `init` message.
* `N`: presented in the `node_announcement` messages
* `C`: presented in the `channel_announcement` message.
* `C-`: presented in the `channel_announcement` message, but always odd (optional).
* `C+`: presented in the `channel_announcement` message, but always even (required).
* `9`: presented in [BOLT 11](11-payment-encoding.md) invoices.
* `B`: presented in the `allowed_features` field of a blinded path.
* `T`: used in the `channel_type` field [when opening channels](02-peer-protocol.md#the-open_channel-message).

## Requirements

The origin node:
  * If it supports a feature above, SHOULD set the corresponding odd
    bit in all feature fields indicated by the Context column unless
	indicated that it must set the even feature bit instead.
  * If it requires a feature above, MUST set the corresponding even
    feature bit in all feature fields indicated by the Context column,
    unless indicated that it must set the odd feature bit instead.
  * MUST NOT set feature bits it does not support.
  * MUST NOT set feature bits in fields not specified by the table above.
  * MUST NOT set both the optional and mandatory bits.
  * MUST set all transitive feature dependencies.
  * MUST support:
    * `var_onion_optin`

The receiving node:
  * if both the optional and the mandatory feature bits in a pair are set,
  the feature should be treated as mandatory.

The requirements for receiving specific bits are defined in the linked sections in the table above.
The requirements for feature bits that are not defined
above can be found in [BOLT #1: The `init` Message](01-messaging.md#the-init-message).

## Rationale

Note that for feature flags which are available in both the `node_announcement`
and [BOLT 11](11-payment-encoding.md) invoice contexts, the features as set in
the [BOLT 11](11-payment-encoding.md) invoice should override those set in the
`node_announcement`. This keeps things consistent with the unknown features
behavior as specified in [BOLT 7](07-routing-gossip.md#the-node_announcement-message).

The origin must set all transitive feature dependencies in order to create a
well-formed feature vector. By validating all known dependencies up front, this
simplifies logic gated on a single feature bit; the feature's dependencies are
known to be set, and do not need to be validated at every feature gate.
